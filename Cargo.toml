# The following patch is to use a version of ark-r1cs-std compatible with
# v0.4.0 but that includes two cherry-picked commits from after v0.4.0 which
# fixes the in-circuit scalar multiplication of the zero point and the
# y-coordinate of the zero point. The commits are respectively from
# https://github.com/arkworks-rs/r1cs-std/pull/124 and
# https://github.com/arkworks-rs/r1cs-std/pull/126, without including other
# changes done between v0.4.0 and this fix which would break compatibility.

# patch ark_curves to use a cherry-picked version which contains
# bn254::constraints & grumpkin for v0.4.0 (once arkworks v0.5.0 is released
# this will no longer be needed)
