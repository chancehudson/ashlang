(a, b) -> ()

# one is a global signal that is equal to 1
# e.g. one === 1
#
# coefficients must be literals
#
# an extra (0,one) is added below
# this evaluates to 0 and is thus a no-op
[(1,a)(0,one)][(1,one)][(1,b)] # assert equality

# no symbolic constraint necessary
# only operating on known values
